# Hangman Game in Pascal

## üéØ Project Description

This project is a complete implementation of the classic **Hangman** game written in **Pascal**, developed as an exercise in structured programming and algorithmic logic. It was designed as a foundational piece for a growing collection of games, progressively increasing in complexity as university knowledge expands.

---

## üìå Key Features

- **Classic mode**: Player 1 inputs a secret word, and Player 2 must guess it.
- Console interface with ASCII-style paper graphics.
- Incorrect guesses progressively draw a hangman figure.
- Input validation with error messages and embedded humor.
- Risk module: the player may take a chance and guess the full word.
- Victory/defeat messages and personalized game stats.
- Modular design with reusable procedures.

---

## üß† Knowledge and Skills Applied

### 1. **Structured Programming**
- Modular use of `procedures` to separate responsibilities and increase readability.
- Use of custom `type` declarations to improve semantic clarity (e.g., `letters`, `picture`, `range2`).

### 2. **Algorithmic Logic**
- Control structures (`repeat`, `while`, `if-then-else`) used to handle input and game flow.
- Error handling and input validation to ensure proper player interaction.

### 3. **Data Structure Design**
- Custom arrays to manage letters and graphics (`array[range] of char`, `picture`).
- Use of `record` types to visually represent the hangman in a structured format.

### 4. **Console Interaction Design**
- Guided conversation style with humorous and motivational messages.
- Menu and confirmation system before the game starts or reveals the word.
- Charging simulation with visual delay (`chargingModule`) for immersion.

### 5. **Robust Error Management**
- Proper handling of invalid characters or repeated inputs.
- Feedback loops that handle mistakes in a player-friendly (and funny) way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Improvements (Backlog)

The following features are considered conceptual at this stage.  
They may be implemented in the future **only if the project proves valuable or meaningful to me**.  
As of now, this is a personal and educational project developed for learning purposes.

1. **Single-player mode** with randomly chosen words.  ‚úÖ (ADDED)
2. **Extra details**: Show all the letters you have already used.
3. **Internationalization (i18n)**: multilingual support (English/Spanish).
4. **Competitive mode** (1v1 with crossed words).
6. **Persistence**: score and player statistics storage.
7.  **More Graphic**: Make it more graphic and less console-like by adapting it to another language.
8. **Experimental Online Multiplayer**: foundation for educational client-server development.

## üß™ How to Compile and Run

1. Open the file using **Free Pascal** or **Turbo Pascal**.
2. Compile the code (`F9` in Free Pascal).
3. Run the program from the console and follow the instructions.

  **Or always you can use the "hangman.exe" with the file "nounlist.txt" allowed hangman_In_Pascal/dist/, download it and push this two files in the same folder**

Project developed as part of university learning, aiming to integrate programming knowledge in a fun and educational way.

For every part where AI was used in the proyect, I added a comment making it clear, so it shows the rest is my own work.
Of course, it‚Äôs normal to use AI for minor details, but I‚Äôd rather be upfront and transparent.

(This README.txt was polished by an AI next the '<image src=>' part. However, it still clearly and honestly reflects my skills and attention to detail, which I focused on fully. 
Thanks for read).
